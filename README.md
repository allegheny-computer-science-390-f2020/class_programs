# CMPSC 390 Programs for Class Activities

## Introduction

Designed for use with [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/), this
repository contains the class participation programming activities for Computer Science 390.
All of the work that you do in class  will count towards your class participation grade.


## Updates

When the course instructor provides the new material for the in-class activity,
 you can type this command in the main directory for this repository:

```
git remote add download https://github.com/allegheny-computer-science-390-f2020/class_programs
```

You should only need to type this command once; typing the command additional
times may yield an error message but will not negatively influence the state of
your repository. Now, you are ready to download the updates provided by the
course instructor by typing:

```
git pull download main --allow-unrelated-histories
```

This second command can be run whenever the course instructor needs to provide
you with new source code for this assignment. However, please note that, if you
have edited the files that the course instructor updated, running the previous
command may lead to Git merge conflicts. If this happens, you may need to
manually resolve them with the help of the instructor.


## Assistance

If you are having trouble completing any part of this project, then please talk
with either the course instructor. 
Alternatively, you may ask questions in the Slack workspace for this course.
